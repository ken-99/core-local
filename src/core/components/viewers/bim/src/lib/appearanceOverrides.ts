/**
 * Flattens the overrides of both trees into a per-element appearance map.
 *
 * Two ordering rules meet here, and they want different things:
 *
 * - **Within one tree**, a node's override cascades to its whole subtree, but a
 *   descendant that carries its own override keeps it. So the spatial tree is
 *   replayed shallowest-first and later writes win — colouring a storey tints
 *   everything in it, and the one wall you coloured separately stays as it was,
 *   whichever order the two were set in.
 * - **Between the trees**, there is no containment to appeal to: `IFCWALL` and a
 *   storey simply overlap. Recency decides, so the tree the user touched most
 *   recently wins the overlap, and undoing that hands the elements back.
 *
 * Hence the sort: trees ordered by their most recent write, nodes within a tree
 * by depth. A half-override merges over what it inherits rather than replacing
 * it, so fading a wall inside a red storey leaves the wall red *and* faded.
 *
 * Overrides naming a node that is no longer in the tree (its model was unloaded)
 * are skipped rather than dropped — reloading the file brings them back.
