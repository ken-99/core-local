 * `color` keeps each element's colour (what an opacity-only override needs) and
 * omitting `opacity` leaves it opaque. `renderedFaces` is left out on purpose:
 * pinning it the way the floorplan highlighter does would force
 * `THREE.DoubleSide` onto everything this paints.
 *
 * `preserveOriginalMaterial` must stay `false`. Fragments skips content
 * deduplication for definitions that set it, and the definition list is
 * append-only behind a `Uint16` index — so the granular `setColor`/`setOpacity`
 * helpers, which set it to `true`, spend one slot per element per call and
 * exhaust the model's ~65 500 slots. At `false` an appearance costs one slot
 * however many elements wear it.
 *
 * The published `MaterialDefinition` marks colour, opacity, transparent and
 * renderedFaces required, so a partial needs the cast. Verified against
 * @thatopen/fragments 3.4.5, whose merge only copies the keys present here.
