/**
 * Owns all four BIM measurement tools and guarantees only one is live at a
 * time.
 *
 * Why a manager rather than one wrapper per kind: the four OBF measurers each
 * bind their own pointer listeners to the canvas when enabled, so leaving two
 * enabled at once means one double-click feeds both. Activation therefore has
 * to be exclusive, which needs a single owner.
 *
 * Three constraints from components-front 3.4.3 / components 3.4.6 are
 * load-bearing here:
 *
 * - `Measurement.enabled`'s setter calls `setEvents()`, which throws
 *   `"Measurement: you must specify a world first!"` when `world` is null — on
 *   `false` just as much as on `true`. So `world` and all config are applied
 *   *before* `enabled = true`, and a measurer never reaches the components list
 *   without a world (see {@link measurerFor}).
 * - `Components.dispose()` writes `component.enabled = false` on **every**
 *   component in insertion order with no try/catch, then disposes it. A single
 *   world-less measurer therefore aborts the whole teardown loop — including
 *   `FragmentsManager`, which OBC deliberately leaves for last. This is why the
 *   measurers are constructed lazily, per kind, and only ever with a world.
 * - The world is resolved on every activation rather than snapshotted in the
 *   constructor. `Components.get()` caches, and the toolbar calls `get()` on
 *   its first render, which can land before `CurrentWorld.world` is published —
 *   a constructor snapshot would cache `null` for the rest of the session.
